 Geospatial web applications developed uisng earthengine, geemap, and streamlit.


### App 1 - Land Surface Temperature

A simple, code-free way to visualize Land Surface Temperature for anywhere on the planet using Landsat satellites. The application is built using geemap and hosted on streamlit.
The code has been adopted from the 2020 paper by Sofia Ermida and colleagues for estimating LST using Single Mono Window (SMW) algorithm.
